            <h3><b>Steps</b></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the refined flour, salt and oil. Add water and knead into a firm but pliable dough.</li>
                <li>Make into 8-10 smooth balls. Roll into thin rounds, about 15cm/6" in diameter, and cut into halves.</li>
                <li>Take one half, wet the edges, and fold the straight edge at the center to bring the two halves together, overlapping a bit to form into a triangular case.</li>
                <li>Press the overlapping portion, and fill the case with the filling, leaving a margin of 1cm/ 1/2 inch all around.</li>
                <li> Press the edges together to seal the samosas.</li>
                <li>Fill all the pieces in the same manner, keeping them covered with a damp cloth.</li>
                <li>Heat oil till a piece of dough thrown in, comes up immediately.</li>
                <li>Add as many samosas as come in without touching each other.</li>
                <li>Lower the heat to medium. Fry to a golden brown on either side. Serve hot, with a chutney.</li>
            </ol>
